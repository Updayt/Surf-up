 ## Summary 
June has a great temperature range to allow the surf and ice cream shop to be successful. The mean temperature is 74.94 degrees Fahrenheit which is a temperature that people will still desire ice cream. The only temperature statistic that worries me is the minimum of 64 degrees Fahrenheit in June, which I believe would be a early morning temperature or night time temperature.  December has mean of 71.04 degrees Fahrenheit, this mean is closer to the colder side, but customers could still desire ice cream. December has a minimum of 56 degrees Fahrenheit which could be an early morning or nigh time temperature. 

The rain data for the month of June produces a mean of .136 inches and December has a mean of .216 inches of rain. Rain is an important piece of weather to look at because with rain can come with storms and colder weather which will reduce the number of surfers for that day thus reducing ice cream sales. The mean for June and December is low, which should not be a concern for the surf and ice cream shop.
